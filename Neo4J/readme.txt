To make knowledge graph for my CS320 Course Project

Steps - 

1. I took my dataset (.csv file) and fed it to ChatGPT and asked for cypher code since Neo4J accepts only cypher code.

2. Set up your Neo4J server (instance) and open and login into it.

3. Go to Query and paste the cypher code produced by ChatGPT and run it. Now that code is fed and database set, you are all set to run commands and get various knowledge graphs.

4. Use the commands given in queries.txt file and enter on the same query section and you'll get the knowledge graph for each type of command.

5. There is another method to get knowledge graph without entering the commands in query section. After you have entered the cypher code in query section go to explore section and press on the "show me a graph" search bar and use the various phrases (attributes) to produce a knowledge base graph for a certain type.

6. I have shown the working in working_shown pdf
